# VR Driver's Ed

A realistic driving test simulation in Virtual Reality, designed for student drivers to practice in a safe environment, away from dangerous road conditions.

Includes a realistic driving environment with 4-way intersections, AI cars to simulate traffic, and smart feedback based on road laws. Designed with Unity Game Engine, Oculus Rift, and Logitech G920 Driving Force Racing Set. Written in C#.

Team members: Miraal Haq, Yanchen Lu, Tim Xiang, and Khushbu Suthar.

My contributions:

- Set up the in-game landscape to resemble a real driving test, featuring roads, intersections, traffic lights and stop signs, and neighborhood buildings on a custom terrain.

- Proposed and laid down a graph representation of roads and intersections as nodes and edges, providing the necessary data structure to implement traffic signals and non-user AI cars' flow of movement for traffic simulation.

- Integrated driving hardware and calibrated inputs from the wheel and pedals to grant the user easier control of the car in Virtual Reality as they interact more naturally with familiar features of a real vehicle.

- Created a responsive feedback interface that detects driving mistakes during the simulation, placed near the dashboard to be comfortable and informative for the user to avoid future mistakes to pass the driving test.
